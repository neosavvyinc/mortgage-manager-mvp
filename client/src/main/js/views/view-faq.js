                                    <p>DocSwap allows a secure document exchange between the lender and home buyer.

                                    <h3 className="bold">When would be best for me to start using DocSwap?</h3>
                                    <p>A home buyer getting organized to seek lending in the near future can use DocSwap without a lender involved, and later invite their lender.</p>
                                    <p>A lender can invite a home buyer to use DocSwap when they meet each other in the bank as a way to help facilitate document exchange required to meet a GSE 1003 compliant application.</p>

                                    <h3 className="bold">Why would I want to use DocSwap as a Lender?</h3>
